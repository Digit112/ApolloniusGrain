# Apollonius

An Apollonian gasket rendering framework in Java 21. This allows you to render zooms of a particular iteration of the Apollonian Gasket fractal precipitating from the ideal circle packing.

For a write-up and explanation of the principles of operation, see [my portfolio](https://evelynsalie.com).

## Run

Run `just run` to run the program.

### Don't have `just`?

Check out their [manual](https://just.systems/man/en/) for an introduction and list of available packages for various systems.

### Arguments

Apollonius's parameters can be found at the top of `Apollonius.main()`. This is currently the only way to configure the application.
